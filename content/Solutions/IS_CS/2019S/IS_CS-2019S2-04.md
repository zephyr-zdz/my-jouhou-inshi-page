## Solution

### Question 1: Execution Time and Throughput without Pipelining

To determine the execution time per instruction, we need to sum up the time taken by each stage since instructions are executed sequentially.

- Fetch: $5 \times 10^{-10}$ seconds
- Decode: $5 \times 10^{-10}$ seconds
- Execute: $5 \times 10^{-10}$ seconds
- Write: $5 \times 10^{-10}$ seconds

The total execution time per instruction is:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = 4 \times (5 \times 10^{-10}) = 2 \times 10^{-9} \text{ seconds/instruction}
$$

The throughput, which is the number of instructions processed per second, is the inverse of the execution time:

$$
\text{Throughput} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5 \times 10^{8} \text{ instructions/second}
$$

### Question 2: Execution with Pipelining

In the pipelining method, the execution of different stages for different instructions overlaps. For example, while the first instruction is in the Execute stage, the second instruction can be in the Decode stage, and the third instruction can be in the Fetch stage.

Assuming an ideal pipelining scenario (without any stalls or hazards), the time to process each instruction after the pipeline is filled is determined by the longest stage time, which is $5 \times 10^{-10}$ seconds.

Thus, the ideal throughput with pipelining is:

$$
\text{Ideal Throughput} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{-10}} = 2 \times 10^{9} \text{ instructions/second}
$$

### Question 3: Pipeline Hazards

Pipeline hazards are situations that prevent the next instruction in the pipeline from executing in its designated clock cycle. There are three main types of hazards:

- **Structural Hazard**: Occurs when hardware resources are insufficient to support all active instructions. For example, if a pipeline requires two ALU operations simultaneously but there is only one ALU available, a structural hazard occurs.

- **Data Hazard**: Occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction still in the pipeline. For instance, if an instruction needs the result of a previous ALU operation, but the result is not yet available, it has to wait.

- **Control Hazard**: Happens when the pipeline makes wrong decisions based on the next instruction (typically involving branches). For example, if the pipeline predicts a branch and loads the wrong instructions, it needs to discard them and fetch the correct ones, causing a delay.

### Question 4: Loop Unrolling Method

**Loop Unrolling** is an optimization technique that aims to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions and improve the pipeline performance by increasing the loop body size. This technique duplicates the loop body multiple times, decreasing the number of iterations and thus reducing the frequency of control hazards (e.g., branch mispredictions).

For example, instead of looping four times to execute a set of instructions, the loop body can be expanded so that it is executed only twice, but each time performing twice the number of operations.

By reducing the number of iterations, loop unrolling can also help in reducing the number of data hazards, as it allows for better scheduling of instructions that use the same data.
