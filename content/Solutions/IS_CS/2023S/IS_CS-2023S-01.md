## 解题思路

本题考察了对给定语言进行操作后生成新语言的过程，涉及正则表达式、上下文无关文法（CFG），以及有限状态自动机（DFA）的构造等内容。需要运用语言和自动机理论中的概念来回答问题，并根据给定语言的性质来推导出新的语言表示。

## Solution

### Question 1: Regular Expression for $\Gamma(L_2)$

Let $L_2 = \{(ab)^n \mid n \geq 0\}$. The language $L_2$ consists of strings of even length formed by repeating the substring "ab".

**Solution**:
To find $\Gamma(L_2)$, consider what $\Gamma(L)$ does. For each string $v \in \Gamma(L_2)$, there exists a string $w$ of the same length such that $vw \in L_2$.

Given that $L_2$ consists of strings of the form $(ab)^n$, the possible strings $v$ must have lengths that can be paired with some $w$ such that their concatenation results in a string from $L_2$.

The key observation is that $v$ can be any prefix of strings from $L_2$. This gives us the possible regular expression:

$$
\Gamma(L_2) = (a + b)^*
$$

This is because for any string $v$ formed from letters $a$ and $b$, there is a corresponding $w$ such that $vw \in L_2$ as long as the length condition is satisfied.

### Question 2: Context-Free Grammar for $\Gamma(L_3)$

Let $L_3 = \{a^n b^n a^m b^m \mid n \geq 0, m \geq 0\}$. This language consists of strings where the numbers of $a$s and $b$s are matched in pairs.

**Solution**:
To generate $\Gamma(L_3)$, consider the strings that can form the beginning of valid strings in $L_3$. Specifically, $\Gamma(L_3)$ includes any prefix of $L_3$ that can be completed to a string in $L_3$. Therefore, $\Gamma(L_3)$ includes strings of the form $a^p b^q a^r b^s$ where $0 \leq p \leq n$, $0 \leq q \leq n$, $0 \leq r \leq m$, and $0 \leq s \leq m$.

A context-free grammar $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ generating $\Gamma(L_3)$ can be defined as follows:

- **Variables**: $S, A, B, C, D$
- **Alphabet**: $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$
- **Rules**:
  - $S \rightarrow AB \mid \epsilon$
  - $A \rightarrow aA \mid B$
  - $B \rightarrow bB \mid C$
  - $C \rightarrow aC \mid D$
  - $D \rightarrow bD \mid \epsilon$

- **Start Symbol**: $S$

This grammar generates strings in the form of prefixes of the strings in $L_3$.

### Question 3: DFA for $\Gamma(L_{\mathcal{M}})$

Let $\mathcal{M} = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts a language $L_{\mathcal{M}}$. We need to construct a DFA $\mathcal{M}'$ that accepts $\Gamma(L_{\mathcal{M}})$.

**Solution**:
To construct $\mathcal{M}'$, consider that $\Gamma(L_{\mathcal{M}})$ consists of strings $v$ such that there exists some $w$ with $|v| = |w|$ and $vw \in L_{\mathcal{M}}$.

- **States**: The states of $\mathcal{M}'$ will be pairs of states from $Q \times Q$, representing the DFA being in a state corresponding to the prefixes $v$ and $w$ of equal length.
- **Transitions**: For each $(p, q) \in Q \times Q$ and for each letter $a \in \Sigma$, if $\delta(p, a) = p'$ and $\delta(q, a) = q'$, then $(p, q) \xrightarrow{a} (p', q')$.
- **Start State**: The start state is $(q_0, q_0)$.
- **Final States**: A pair $(p, q)$ is a final state if there exists some $p' \in Q$ and $q' \in F$ such that $(p, q)$ transitions to $(p', q')$ by some string.

This DFA $\mathcal{M}'$ accepts exactly the strings in $\Gamma(L_{\mathcal{M}})$ by simulating the original DFA on both halves of the string in parallel.

### Question 4: Context-Free Language Proposition

**Proposition**: "For every context-free language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, $\Gamma(L)$ is a context-free language."

**Solution**:
The proposition is **false**. A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Consider the context-free language $L = \{a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 1\}$, which is known to be context-free. However, $\Gamma(L)$ would include strings like $a^p b^q c^r$ where $p, q, r$ do not necessarily follow the strict condition $p = q = r$. The language $\Gamma(L)$ can be shown to be non-context-free because it requires balancing different parts of the string in a way that a context-free grammar cannot generally handle.

This counterexample demonstrates that $\Gamma(L)$ is not necessarily context-free even if $L$ is.
