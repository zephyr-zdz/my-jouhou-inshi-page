## Solution

### Question 1: Verify if the array $[6, 3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 2]$ is a heap

To determine if the given array is a heap, we need to check if for every $i > 1$, the condition $H[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor] \geq H[i]$ holds.

- $i = 2$: $\lfloor 2/2 \rfloor = 1 \Rightarrow H[1] = 6 \geq H[2] = 3$
- $i = 3$: $\lfloor 3/2 \rfloor = 1 \Rightarrow H[1] = 6 \geq H[3] = 4$
- $i = 4$: $\lfloor 4/2 \rfloor = 2 \Rightarrow H[2] = 3 \geq H[4] = 1$
- $i = 5$: $\lfloor 5/2 \rfloor = 2 \Rightarrow H[2] = 3 \geq H[5] = 0$
- $i = 6$: $\lfloor 6/2 \rfloor = 3 \Rightarrow H[3] = 4 \geq H[6] = 3$
- $i = 7$: $\lfloor 7/2 \rfloor = 3 \Rightarrow H[3] = 4 \geq H[7] = 4$
- $i = 8$: $\lfloor 8/2 \rfloor = 4 \Rightarrow H[4] = 1 < H[8] = 2$

Since $H[4] = 1$ is not greater than or equal to $H[8] = 2$, the array $[6, 3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 2]$ is **not a heap**.

### Question 2: Subheap Property

**Statement:** If $H[1, \ldots, n]$ is a heap, then $H[1, \ldots, j]$ is also a heap for any $j$ $(1 \leq j < n)$.

**Proof:**
Let $H[1, \ldots, n]$ be a heap, meaning $H[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor] \geq H[i]$ for all $1 < i \leq n$. Consider any $j < n$. Since the heap property holds for all elements in $H[1, \ldots, n]$, it will also hold for all elements in $H[1, \ldots, j]$ because the parent-child relationships in the heap are preserved up to index $j$. Therefore, $H[1, \ldots, j]$ is also a heap.

### Question 3: Fixing the Heap Property after Insertion

Suppose $H[1, \ldots, n]$ is a heap, but after inserting an element at position $n+1$, the array $H[1, \ldots, n+1]$ is not a heap. The violation of the heap property could only occur if the newly inserted element at position $n+1$ is greater than its parent. To fix this, we perform the **heapify-up** operation.

**Heapify-up Procedure:**
1. Let $i = n+1$.
2. While $i > 1$ and $H[i] > H[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor]$:
   - Swap $H[i]$ and $H[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor]$.
   - Set $i = \lfloor i/2 \rfloor$.

**Time Complexity:** The worst-case time complexity of this procedure is $O(\log n)$, as we may need to traverse up the height of the heap, which is logarithmic in terms of the number of elements.

### Question 4: Extract-Max and Heapify-down

**Proof that $H[1]$ is the maximum element in $H[1, \ldots, n]$:**
By the definition of a max-heap, the root node (i.e., $H[1]$) must be greater than or equal to all its children. By induction, it can be proven that $H[1]$ is greater than or equal to all elements in the heap. Hence, $H[1]$ is the maximum element.

**Heapify-down Procedure:**
After replacing $H[1]$ with $H[n]$, if $H[1, \ldots, n-1]$ is not a heap, we need to restore the heap property by performing the **heapify-down** operation.

1. Let $i = 1$.
2. While $2i \leq n-1$ (i.e., while $i$ has at least one child):
   - Let $j = 2i$ (left child).
   - If $j < n-1$ and $H[j+1] > H[j]$, set $j = j+1$ (right child is larger).
   - If $H[i] \geq H[j]$, break the loop.
   - Swap $H[i]$ and $H[j]$.
   - Set $i = j$.

**Time Complexity:** The worst-case time complexity of this procedure is $O(\log n)$, as we may need to traverse down the height of the heap.

### Question 5: Build Heap from Unordered Array

To convert an unordered array $H[1, \ldots, n]$ into a heap, we can use the **build-heap** algorithm:

**Build-Heap Algorithm:**
1. Start from the last non-leaf node, $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$.
2. Perform heapify-down on each node from $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ to 1.

**Time Complexity:** The build-heap process has a time complexity of $O(n)$, as it performs a linear number of operations over the array.

### Question 6: Heapsort Algorithm

Using the above procedures, we can describe the Heapsort algorithm:

1. **Build-Heap**: Convert the array $H[1, \ldots, n]$ into a max-heap.
2. **Extract-Max repeatedly**: Swap $H[1]$ with $H[n]$, reduce the size of the heap by 1, and then perform heapify-down on $H[1, \ldots, n-1]$.
3. Repeat the above step until the heap size is reduced to 1.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of Heapsort is $O(n \log n)$ because:
- Building the heap takes $O(n)$ time.
- Each extraction and heapify-down takes $O(\log n)$ time, and there are $n$ such extractions.

## 解题技巧和信息

堆问题的核心是维护堆的性质，通过理解堆的定义（最大堆或最小堆）来选择合适的操作（如 heapify-up 或 heapify-down）。在建堆和堆排序时，关注堆的高度和操作的时间复杂度。堆操作通常具有 $O(\log n)$ 的时间复杂度，而建堆的复杂度为 $O(n)$。
