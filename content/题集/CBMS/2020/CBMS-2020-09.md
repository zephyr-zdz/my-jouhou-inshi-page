## Solution

### Problem 1

**Prove that the sum of degrees of all vertices of an undirected graph is even.**

In an undirected graph, each edge contributes 2 to the sum of the degrees of the vertices because each edge is incident to two vertices. Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.

$$
\text{Sum of degrees} = \sum_{v \in V} \deg(v)
$$

Each edge $e \in E$ connects two vertices and contributes 1 to the degree of each vertex it connects. Therefore, each edge contributes exactly 2 to the sum of degrees. Let $\left| E \right|$ denote the number of edges.

$$
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2 \left| E \right|
$$

Since $\left| E \right|$ is an integer, $2 \left| E \right|$ is even. Hence, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is even.

### Problem 2

**Chemical formula $C_5H_{12}$ corresponds to several structural isomers. Show all isomers as graphs.**

The structural isomers of pentane ($C_5H_{12}$) can be represented as graphs where each vertex represents a carbon atom, and each edge represents a bond between carbon atoms. The hydrogen atoms are implied but not shown in the graphs for simplicity.

1. **n-Pentane:**

    ```plaintext
    H   H   H   H   H
    |   |   |   |   |
    H - C - C - C - C - C - H
        |   |   |   |   |
        H   H   H   H   H
    ```

2. **Isopentane (2-Methylbutane):**

    ```plaintext
        H   H   H
        |   |   |
        C - C - C - C - H
        |   |   |
        H   H   C
            |   |
            H   H
    ```

3. **Neopentane (2,2-Dimethylpropane):**

    ```plaintext
            H   H
            |   |
        H - C - C - H
            |   |
        H - C - C - H
            |   |
            H   H
    ```

### Problem 3

**Three servers are connected as in the graph below. The network is functional when the graph is connected. Each edge disconnects independently with probability $p$. Find the probability of the network being functional as a function of $p$.**

The graph of the network is a triangle:

```plaintext
O
|\
| \
|  \
O---O
```

To find the probability that the network is functional (connected), we need to consider the cases where the graph remains connected.

1. **All edges are connected:**

$$
P(\text{All edges connected}) = (1 - p)^3
$$

1. **Exactly one edge fails:**

The network remains connected if exactly one edge fails because the remaining two edges still connect all vertices.

$$
P(\text{Exactly one edge fails}) = \binom{3}{1} p (1 - p)^2 = 3p(1 - p)^2
$$

1. **More than one edge fails:**

If two or three edges fail, the network becomes disconnected. The probability of these events does not need to be computed explicitly since they are complementary to the first two cases.

The total probability of the network being functional is the sum of the probabilities of the above two cases:

$$
P(\text{Network functional}) = (1 - p)^3 + 3p(1 - p)^2 = 4p^3 - 9 p^2 +6p +1 = 2p^3 - 3p^2 + 1
$$
