## 解题思路

这道题涉及堆（Heap）的构建和堆排序的实现。首先，需要在 $O(n)$ 时间复杂度内构建一个堆；其次，证明堆顶元素为最大值；最后，利用堆进行排序，实现时间复杂度为 $O(n \log n)$ 的排序算法。构建堆的过程需要用到自底向上的堆化操作（heapify），堆排序则通过反复提取最大元素，并调整剩余元素来实现。

## Solution

### Question 1: Algorithm to Make $H[1, \ldots, n]$ a Heap in $O(n)$ Worst-case Time

To build a heap in $O(n)$ time, we can use the "Build-Heap" algorithm which involves calling the "Heapify" function starting from the lowest level of the tree up to the root.

**Pseudo-code:**

```plaintext
BUILD-HEAP(H)
  n = length(H)
  for i = ⌊n / 2⌋ downto 1
    HEAPIFY(H, i)

HEAPIFY(H, i)
  left = 2 * i
  right = 2 * i + 1
  largest = i
  
  if left ≤ n and H[left] > H[largest]
    largest = left
  if right ≤ n and H[right] > H[largest]
    largest = right
    
  if largest ≠ i
    swap H[i] and H[largest]
    HEAPIFY(H, largest)
```

### Question 2: Proof that $H[1]$ is the Maximum Element if $H[1, \ldots, n]$ is a Heap

**Proof:**

If $H[1, \ldots, n]$ is a heap, by definition:

$$
H\left[\left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor\right] \geq H[i] \quad \text{for} \quad 2 \leq i \leq n
$$

For the root element $H[1]$, consider any element $H[i]$ in the array. Since $i \geq 2$, by the heap property, we have:

$$
H\left[\left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor\right] \geq H[i]
$$

By repeatedly applying this property up the tree from any node to the root, it is evident that no descendant of $H[1]$ can have a value greater than $H[1]$. Thus, $H[1]$ is the maximum element in the heap.

### Question 3: Algorithm to Sort an Arbitrary Array $H[1, \ldots, n]$ in $O(n \log n)$ Worst-case Time

We can use the heap sort algorithm to sort the array. The algorithm involves building a heap from the array and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and rebuilding the heap with the remaining elements.

**Pseudo-code:**

```plaintext
HEAP-SORT(H)
  BUILD-HEAP(H)
  n = length(H)
  for i = n downto 2
    swap H[1] and H[i]
    n = n - 1
    HEAPIFY(H, 1)

BUILD-HEAP(H)
  n = length(H)
  for i = ⌊n / 2⌋ downto 1
    HEAPIFY(H, i)

HEAPIFY(H, i)
  left = 2 * i
  right = 2 * i + 1
  largest = i
  
  if left ≤ n and H[left] > H[largest]
    largest = left
  if right ≤ n and H[right] > H[largest]
    largest = right
    
  if largest ≠ i
    swap H[i] and H[largest]
    HEAPIFY(H, largest)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **BUILD-HEAP** constructs a max-heap from the array in $O(n)$ time.
2. **HEAPIFY** ensures the heap property is maintained.
3. **HEAP-SORT** repeatedly extracts the maximum element (root of the heap) and moves it to the end of the array, then reduces the heap size by one and calls **HEAPIFY** to maintain the heap property. This takes $O(n \log n)$ time.

## 解题技巧和信息

1. **Build-Heap Time Complexity**: The BUILD-HEAP function runs in $O(n)$ time. Although it appears there are $n/2$ calls to HEAPIFY, the time complexity analysis shows that the total time is linear due to the nature of heap levels.
2. **Heapify Function**: The HEAPIFY function runs in $O(\log n)$ time since it takes at most the height of the heap to restore the heap property.
3. **Heap Sort**: By building the heap in $O(n)$ time and then performing $n$ extractions, each taking $O(\log n)$ time, heap sort achieves an overall time complexity of $O(n \log n)$.
