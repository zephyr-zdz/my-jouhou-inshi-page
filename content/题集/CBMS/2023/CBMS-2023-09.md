## 具体题目

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed acyclic graph such that $V$ is the set of integers from $1$ to $n$ $(n \geq 3)$. We will consider the following sets of edges for $E$.

$$
E_1 = \{(1, i), (i, n) \mid i = 2, \ldots, n-1\}
$$

$$
E_2 = \{(i, i+1) \mid i = 1, \ldots, n-1\} \cup \{(i, i+2) \mid i = 1, \ldots, n-2\}
$$

1. Consider a bijective function $f$ from $V$ to $V$ such that $f(u) < f(v)$ for any $(u, v) \in E$. For each of $E_1$ and $E_2$, answer the number of all different bijective functions and the rationale.

2. For each of $E_1$ and $E_2$, answer the number of all different paths from $1$ to $n$ (or a recurrence for computing the number), and the rationale.

3. For any directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$, design an algorithm that calculates the number of paths from $s$ to $t$ in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time for any $s, t \in V$, and explain the rationale.

## 正确解答

### Part 1: Bijective Functions

#### Bijective Function Explanation

A bijective function $f: V \rightarrow V$ is a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). This means every element in $V$ maps to a unique element in $V$, and every element in $V$ is mapped to by exactly one element in $V$. For the given problem, we are interested in bijective functions that also respect the condition $f(u) < f(v)$ for any edge $(u, v) \in E$.

#### For $E_1$

- **Structure**: The graph $G$ with edges $E_1$ has two types of edges: from vertex 1 to every other vertex $i \in \{2, \ldots, n-1\}$, and from every vertex $i \in \{2, \ldots, n-1\}$ to vertex $n$. Thus, $f(1)$ must be the smallest and $f(n)$ must be the largest.

- **Ordering**: The remaining values $\{f(2), \ldots, f(n-1)\}$ must be placed in increasing order between $f(1)$ and $f(n)$.

- **Number of bijective functions**: Given that $f(1)$ and $f(n)$ are fixed as the smallest and largest respectively, the remaining $n-2$ vertices can be permuted freely.

$$
 (n-2)! 
$$

#### For $E_2$

- **Structure**: The graph $G$ with edges $E_2$ has edges from each vertex $i$ to $i+1$ and $i+2$.

- **Ordering**: For $f$ to satisfy $f(u) < f(v)$ for all $(u, v) \in E_2$, $f(i)$ must be in ascending order for all $i$.

- **Number of bijective functions**: There is only one valid permutation: the natural ordering $f(i) = i$.

$$
1
$$

### Part 2: Number of Paths from $1$ to $n$

#### For $E_1$

- **Path Analysis**: From $1$ to $n$, the paths must pass through an intermediate vertex $i$.

- **Paths**: Each vertex $i$ in $\{2, \ldots, n-1\}$ provides a unique path $1 \rightarrow i \rightarrow n$.

$$
 \text{Number of paths} = n-2
$$

#### For $E_2$

- **Path Analysis**: From $1$ to $n$, paths can be analyzed using dynamic programming:

  Define $P(k)$ as the number of paths from $1$ to $k$.

$$
 P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2)
$$

  - Base cases: $P(1) = 1$ (direct path from 1 to 1)
  - For $P(2)$, there is also a direct path, so $P(2) = 1$.

- **Recurrence relation**: Compute the number of paths to each vertex until $P(n)$.

### Part 3: Algorithm for Number of Paths in a DAG

#### Algorithm

- Initialize an array $P$ of size $|V|$ to store the number of paths to each vertex.
- Initialize $P(s) = 1$ for the starting vertex $s$.
- Traverse the vertices in topological order, and update the number of paths to each vertex based on the incoming edges.
  - For each vertex $v$, iterate over its incoming neighbors $u$ and update $P(v) += P(u)$.
- Once all vertices are processed, the number of paths to the destination vertex $t$ will be stored in $P(t)$.

#### Time Complexity

- The topological sort can be done in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time.
- Updating the number of paths for each vertex takes $O(|E|)$ time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is $O(|V| + |E|)$.
