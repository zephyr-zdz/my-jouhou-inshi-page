**题目主题**：CS-图论-欧拉路径与欧拉回路

## 解题思路

这道题目主要涉及以下几个方面：

1. 根据给定的字符串构建有向图
2. 在构建的有向图中寻找欧拉路径和欧拉回路
3. 证明欧拉回路与图的连通性和平衡性之间的关系

我们需要先理解如何从字符串构建有向图，然后分析这些图的特性来找出欧拉路径和欧拉回路。对于证明部分，我们将使用欧拉回路的性质来论证图的连通性和平衡性，然后反过来证明连通且平衡的图一定存在欧拉回路。

## Solution

### 1. Eulerian paths and cycles in $G_{L,2}$ for $L = ACACA$

Given $L = ACACA$, we construct $G_{L,2}$ as follows:

Vertex set: $V = \{AC, CA\}$

Labeled arc set: $E = \{(AC, CA, 1), (CA, AC, 2), (AC, CA, 3)\}$

To find all Eulerian paths and cycles, we need to traverse all arcs exactly once.

Eulerian paths:

1. $(AC, CA, 1) \rightarrow (CA, AC, 2) \rightarrow (AC, CA, 3)$
2. $(CA, AC, 2) \rightarrow (AC, CA, 3) \rightarrow (AC, CA, 1)$
3. $(AC, CA, 3) \rightarrow (CA, AC, 2) \rightarrow (AC, CA, 3)$

There are no Eulerian cycles in $G_{L,2}$.

### 2. Eulerian paths and cycles in $G_{L,3}$ and $G_{L,4}$ for $L = GCGCGCAGCG$

#### For $G_{L,3}$

Vertex set: $V = \{GCG, CGC, GCA, CAG, AGC\}$

Labeled arc set:

$$E = \{(GCG, CGC, 1), (CGC, GCG, 2), (GCG, CGC, 3), (CGC, GCA, 4), (GCA, CAG, 5), (CAG, AGC, 6), (AGC, GCG, 7)\}$$

Eulerian cycle (also as Eulerian path):

$GCG \rightarrow (GCG, CGC, 1) \rightarrow (CGC, GCG, 2) \rightarrow (GCG, CGC, 3) \rightarrow (CGC, GCA, 4) \rightarrow (GCA, CAG, 5) \rightarrow (CAG, AGC, 6) \rightarrow (AGC, GCG, 7) \rightarro GCG$

#### For $G_{L,4}$

Vertex set: $V = \{GCGC, CGCG, GCGC, CGCA, GCAG, CAGC, AGCG\}$

Labeled arc set: $E = \{(GCGC, CGCG, 1), (CGCG, GCGC, 2), (GCGC, CGCA, 3), (CGCA, GCAG, 4), (GCAG, CAGC, 5), (CAGC, AGCG, 6)\}$

Eulerian path:

$(GCGC, CGCG, 1) \rightarrow (CGCG, GCGC, 2) \rightarrow (GCGC, CGCA, 3) \rightarrow (CGCA, GCAG, 4) \rightarrow (GCAG, CAGC, 5) \rightarrow (CAGC, AGCG, 6)$

There are no Eulerian cycles in $G_{L,4}$.

### 3. Proof: A directed graph with an Eulerian cycle is connected and balanced

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph with an Eulerian cycle $C$.

**Note**: We assume that $G$ does not contain any isolated vertices (vertices with both in-degree and out-degree equal to 0), or if such vertices exist, we consider them as irrelevant to the Eulerian cycle and the properties we are about to prove.

#### Connectedness

Suppose $G$ is not connected. Then there exist vertices $u, v \in V$ such that there is no path from $u$ to $v$. However, the Eulerian cycle $C$ visits every edge in $G$ exactly once, which means it visits every non-isolated vertex at least once. Therefore, $C$ provides a path from $u$ to $v$, contradicting our assumption. Thus, $G$ must be connected.

#### Balance

Let $v \in V$ be any non-isolated vertex in $G$. Every time the Eulerian cycle $C$ enters $v$, it must also leave $v$, including the starting/ending vertex which is entered in the last step of the cycle. Therefore, the number of edges entering $v$ is equal to the number of edges leaving $v$. Since this is true for all non-isolated vertices, $G$ is balanced.

### 4. Proof: A connected and balanced directed graph has an Eulerian cycle

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected and balanced directed graph. We will prove this by constructing an Eulerian cycle.

1. Start at any vertex $v_0 \in V$.
2. Choose any outgoing arc and follow it to the next vertex.
3. Continue this process, each time choosing an unused arc, until we return to $v_0$.

This process must terminate because:

  a) The graph is balanced, so we can always leave a vertex we've entered (except possibly $v_0$).

  b) The number of arcs is finite, so we must eventually return to $v_0$.

Let's call the cycle we've constructed $C$. If $C$ includes all arcs in $G$, we're done. If not, consider the subgraph $G' = (V', E')$ where $V'$ is the set of vertices incident to unused arcs, and $E'$ is the set of unused arcs.

1. $G'$ is balanced: The balance of vertices in $G'$ is unaffected by removing the equal number of incoming and outgoing arcs in $C$.
2. $G'$ is connected to $C$: If it weren't, $G$ would not be connected.

Choose a vertex $v'$ in $G'$ that's also in $C$. Start a new cycle $C'$ from $v'$ in $G'$ using the same process as before. We can then combine $C$ and $C'$ into a larger cycle.

Repeat this process until all arcs are used. The result is an Eulerian cycle in $G$.
