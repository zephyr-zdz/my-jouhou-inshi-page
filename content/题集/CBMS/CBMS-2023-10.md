## 具体题目

There are two points $A$, $B$ and $2^n$ data points $P_1, \cdots, P_{2^n}$ in a 2-dimensional Euclidean plane. Assume that the distance $\epsilon$ between $A$ and $B$, and the distances $a_1, \cdots, a_{2^n}$ between $A$ and the data points are given. The distances $b_1, \cdots, b_{2^n}$ between $B$ and the data points are not given, but a function $f(P_i, P_j)$ defined below can be used to identify the sign of $b_i - b_j$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq 2^n$.

$$
f(P_i, P_j) = \mathrm{sgn}(b_i - b_j) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } b_i - b_j > 0 \\
0 & \text{if } b_i - b_j = 0 \\
-1 & \text{if } b_i - b_j < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Assume that $|a_i - a_j| > \epsilon$ for any $a_i, a_j$ $(1 \leq i \leq j \leq 2^n)$.

1. Show the pseudo-code of an algorithm to sort $P_1, \cdots, P_{2^n}$ by ascending order of the distances from $A$ in $O(n2^n)$ worst computational time.
2. Explain why the worst computational time of the algorithm shown in (1) is $O(n2^n)$.
3. Prove that if $a_i - a_j > 2\epsilon$ then $b_i > b_j$.
4. When $P_1, \cdots, P_{2^n}$ are already sorted by ascending order of the distances from $A$, show an algorithm to sort by ascending order of the distances from $B$ that calls function $f$ the minimum number of times, and evaluate that number of times.

### 1. Pseudo-code to sort $P_1, \cdots, P_{2^n}$ by ascending order of the distances from $A$

```python
def merge_sort_by_distances_from_A(points, distances_from_A):
    if len(points) <= 1:
        return points
    mid = len(points) // 2
    left_half = merge_sort_by_distances_from_A(points[:mid], distances_from_A[:mid])
    right_half = merge_sort_by_distances_from_A(points[mid:], distances_from_A[mid:])
    return merge(left_half, right_half, distances_from_A)

def merge(left, right, distances_from_A):
    sorted_points = []
    while left and right:
        if distances_from_A[left[0]] < distances_from_A[right[0]]:
            sorted_points.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            sorted_points.append(right.pop(0))
    sorted_points.extend(left)
    sorted_points.extend(right)
    return sorted_points

points = [P_1, P_2, ..., P_{2^n}]
distances_from_A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2^n}]
sorted_points = merge_sort_by_distances_from_A(points, distances_from_A)
```

P.S.: Quicksort can also be used to sort the points by distances from $A$ in $O(n2^n)$ worst computational time.

### 2. Explain the worst computational time of the algorithm shown in (1) is $O(n2^n)$

The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of $O(k \log k)$, where $k$ is the number of elements to sort because it divides the array into two halves and recursively sorts them in a time complexity of $O(k)$ in each step. In this case, $k = 2^n$, so the time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is $O(n2^n)$.

### 3. Prove that if $a_i - a_j > 2\epsilon$ then $b_i > b_j$

Consider 2 triangles formed by points $A$, $B$, and $P_i$, $P_j$:

- $\triangle ABP_i$ with sides $a_i$, $b_i$, and $\epsilon$

- $\triangle ABP_j$ with sides $a_j$, $b_j$, and $\epsilon$

By the triangle inequality, we have:

$$
b_i + \epsilon \geq a_i \quad \text{and} \quad a_i + \epsilon \geq b_i
$$

Given that $a_i - a_j > 2\epsilon$, we can write:

$$
b_i + \epsilon \geq a_i > a_j + 2\epsilon \geq b_j + \epsilon
$$

Therefore, $b_i > b_j$.

### 4. Algorithm to sort by ascending order of the distances from $B$

Given that $|a_i - a_j| > \epsilon$ for any $a_i, a_j$, we can find out that for any $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq 2^n-2$), $a_{i+2} - a_i > 2\epsilon$ since $|a_{i+2} - a_i| = |a_{i+2} - a_{i+1} + a_{i+1} - a_i| \geq |a_{i+2} - a_{i+1}| + |a_{i+1} - a_i| > 2\epsilon$. This implies that $b_{i+2} > b_i$ by the proof in (3).

Therefore, we can sort $B_1, \cdots, B_{2^n}$ by combining two sorted arrays $B_{2i}$ and $B_{2i+1}$, where $B_{2i+1}$ and $B_{2i}$ are sorted by $a_{2i+1}$ and $a_{2i}$, respectively.

So we can use the following algorithm to merge two sorted arrays $B_{2i}$ and $B_{2i+1}$:

```python
def sort_by_distances_from_B(points, distances_from_A, distances_from_B):
    # 2^n points sorted by distances from A
    sorted_points = []
    i, j = 0, 0 # Pointers for the two sorted arrays

    # Merge the two sorted arrays of n/2 points each
    while i < len(points) and j < len(points):
        if f(points[i], points[j]) == 1: # b_i > b_j
            sorted_points.append(points[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_points.append(points[j])
            j += 1

    return sorted_points
```

#### Evaluation of the number of times the function $f$ is called

The function $f$ is called $2^{n-1}$ times in the worst case. This is because the function $f$ is called for each pair of points in the two sorted arrays of $2^{n-1}$ points each. The function $f$ is called $2^{n-1}$ times to compare the distances between the points in the two arrays.
