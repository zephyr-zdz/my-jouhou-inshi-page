## 具体题目

Let $G = (\mathbf{V}, \mathbf{E})$ be a connected simple undirected graph with a set $\mathbf{V}$ of $n \ge 2$ vertices and a set $\mathbf{E}$ of edges, let $T = (\mathbf{V}, \mathbf{F})$ be a spanning tree of $G$ rooted at a vertex $s \in \mathbf{V}$, and let $\ell : \mathbf{V} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ be a numbering on $\mathbf{V}$, where we assume that the following conditions (a) and (b) hold.

(a) For each edge $uv \in \mathbf{E}$, vertex $u$ is either an ancestor or a descendant of $v$ in $T$,

(b) For each vertex $v \in \mathbf{V} \setminus \{s\}$ and the parent $u$ of $v$ in $T$, $\ell(u) < \ell(v)$.

Let $L$ denote the set of leaves in $T$. For each vertex $v \in \mathbf{V}$, let $\mathbf{N}(v)$ denote the set of neighbors of $v$ in $G$, and let $\mathbf{D}(v)$ denote the set consisting of vertex $v$ and the descendants of $v$ in $T$. Define a function $\text{lowpt} : \mathbf{V} \setminus (L \cup \{s\}) \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that

$$
\text{lowpt}(v) = \min \{\ell(y) \mid y \in \bigcup_{x \in \mathbf{D}(v)} \mathbf{N}(x)\}, \quad v \in \mathbf{V} \setminus (L \cup \{s\}).
$$

Answer the following questions.

(i) Prove that no leaf $u \in L$ is a cut-vertex in $G$.

(ii) Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the root $s$ to be a cut-vertex in $G$ is that $s$ has at least two children in $T$.

(iii) Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for a vertex $u \in \mathbf{V} \setminus (L \cup \{s\})$ to be a cut-vertex in $G$ is that $u$ has a child $v$ in $T$ such that $\text{lowpt}(v) \ge \ell(u)$.

## 正确解答

### (i) Prove that no leaf $u \in L$ is a cut-vertex in $G$

A1:

A cut-vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in $G$. Consider a leaf $u \in L$. By definition, $u$ has no children in $T$ and only one parent $p$.

If we remove $u$ from $G$, all other vertices remain connected through $p$ and the rest of the spanning tree $T$. Therefore, removing a leaf $u$ does not disconnect the graph $G$, proving that no leaf $u \in L$ is a cut-vertex.

### (ii) Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the root $s$ to be a cut-vertex in $G$ is that $s$ has at least two children in $T$

A2:

**Necessary Condition:**

If $s$ is a cut-vertex, removing $s$ should increase the number of connected components. This happens only if there are at least two disjoint subtrees rooted at the children of $s$. Hence, $s$ must have at least two children.

**Sufficient Condition:**
If $s$ has at least two children, removing $s$ will separate the graph into at least two disjoint subtrees, each rooted at one of the children. Therefore, $s$ is a cut-vertex if it has at least two children.

### (iii) Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for a vertex $u \in \mathbf{V} \setminus (L \cup \{s\})$ to be a cut-vertex in $G$ is that $u$ has a child $v$ in $T$ such that $\text{lowpt}(v) \ge \ell(u)$

A3:

**Necessary Condition:**

If $u$ is a cut-vertex, removing $u$ will increase the number of connected components. For $u$ to be a cut-vertex, at least one of its children $v$ must have no back edge connecting any descendant of $v$ (including $v$ itself) to an ancestor of $u$. This means $\text{lowpt}(v) \ge \ell(u)$.

**Sufficient Condition:**
If $u$ has a child $v$ such that $\text{lowpt}(v) \ge \ell(u)$, removing $u$ will disconnect $v$ and its descendants from the rest of the graph, making $u$ a cut-vertex.
